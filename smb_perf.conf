# WHEN "strict locking = no", THE SERVER PERFORMS FILE LOCK
# CHECKS ONLY WHEN THE CLIENT EXPLICITLY ASKS FOR THEM.
# WELL-BEHAVED CLIENTS ALWAYS ASK FOR LOCK CHECKS WHEN IT IS
# IMPORTANT, SO IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES,
# "strict locking = auto" OR "strict locking = no" IS ACCEPTABLE.

	strict locking = no

# FORCE THE DISK SYSTEM TO ALLOCATE REAL STORAGE BLOCKS WHEN
# A FILE IS CREATED OR EXTENDED TO BE A GIVEN SIZE.
# THIS IS ONLY A GOOD OPTION FOR FILE SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT
# UNWRITTEN EXTENTS LIKE XFS, EXT4, BTRFS, OCS2.
# IF YOU USE A FILE SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT SUPPORT UNWRITTEN
# EXTENTS, SET "strict allocate = no".

	strict allocate = yes

# SMBWriteX CALLS GREATER THAN "min receivefile size" WILL BE
# PASSED DIRECTLY TO KERNEL recvfile/splice SYSTEM CALL.
# TO ENABLE POSIX LARGE WRITE SUPPORT (SMB/CIFS WRITES UP TO 16MB),
# THIS OPTION MUST BE NONZERO.
# THIS OPTION WILL HAVE NO EFFECT IF SET ON A SMB SIGNED CONNECTION.
# MAX VALUE = 128k

	min receivefile size = 16384

# USE THE MORE EFFICIENT sendfile() SYSTEM CALL FOR EXCLUSIVELY
# OPLOCKED FILES.
# NOTE: ONLY FOR CLIENTS HIGHER THAN WINDOWS 98/Me
